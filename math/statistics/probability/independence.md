# Independence

Two events are independent if knowing the outcome of one event does not change
the probability of the other.

```
P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B)

multiplication rule for independent events

P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)
```

Events are mutually independent if for _every_ subset of events the multiplication
rule applies.

Use these rules to prove components are independent or not, then you can assume
the rules are true and draw conclusions.

If `A ∩ B = {}`, then knowing that one event occurred means that the other event
conclusively did not occur. So even though they may seem independent, they are
actually dependent.
