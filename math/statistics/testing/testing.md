# Hypothesis Testing

Null hypothesis: what we assume is true.
Alternative hypothesis: what you are trying to show.

## Developing a test

1. Choose an estimator for the statistic you are working with
2. Give the form of the test

Ex: reject the null hypothesis if our sample mean is greater than some value c.

3. Find c
4. Give a conclusion

## Errors

- Type 1

The null hypothesis is true but you reject it.

Probability of making this error is Denoted alpha, and called level of significance or size of the test.

- Type 2

The null hypothesis is false but you fail to reject it.
