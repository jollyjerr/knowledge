# Proofs

A theorem is a statement that can be proven to be true, and a proof is the
formal process of showing that it is true via a series of steps consisting of
axioms (assumed truth), proven theorems, and logic.

Writing proofs is formally done like:

```
Theorem:
Every positive integer is less than
or equal to its square.

Proof:
Let x be an integer, where  x > 0

Since x > 0, we can multiply both
sides of the inequality by x to get: x*x >= 1x

Simplify the expression we get: x^2 >= x âˆŽ
```

## Universal Proofs

### Proof by Exhaustion

If you literally walk through every element of a domain and prove a statement is
true for each element, you have proven the universally qualified statement as
true via exhaustion.

### Universal Generalization

Name an arbitrary object of a theorem's domain and prove the theorem for that
object.

The example at the top of this document is a universal generalization.

Remember that you only need a single counterexample to prove universally
quantified statements as false. A counterexample needs to satisfy all the
hypotheses but contradict the conclusion.

## Existential Proofs
