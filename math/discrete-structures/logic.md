# Propositional Logic

## Building blocks

### Proposition

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.

The proposition's truth value is a value indicating if the proposition is
actually true or false.

### Compound Proposition

A compound proposition is multiple propositions connected by a logical operator.

∧ - and (conjunction)
∨ - or (disjunction)

example: (true ∧ false) = false

In the absence of parentheses negation is applied first, then conjunction, then disjunction.

##### Disjunctions

Typically "or" in English is used to mean "exclusive or" (denoted with ⊕):

false or true = true
true or true = false

But the disjuction operator is an inclusive or:

false or true = true
true or true = true

### Negation

The ¬ operator negates, or reverses the truth value, of a proposition.

¬(true ∧ false) = true
