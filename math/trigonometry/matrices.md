# Matrices

Matrix dimensions are always given "rows x columns" and are usually named with a capital:

```
A 3 x 2 matrix would be:

K = |a b|
    |c d|
    |e f|
```

You access different entries like `K2,2 == d`

## Augmented Matrix

You can use a matrix to represent a system of equations

```
3x + 2y = 7  |3  2  7|
x - 6y = 0   |1  -6 0|
```

Just make sure to line up the coefficients and everything

## Row operations

You can switch two rows without changing the value of a matrix. Notation: `R2 <--> R3`

You can also multiply any row by a constant.

You can also add rows together `R1 + R2 -> R1` (replace R1 with the sum of R1 and R2)
