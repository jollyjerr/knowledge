# Polar Curves

Graphing polar curves is basically the same as graphing other functions but using the polar system:

1. Set the argument of the function to pi/2 and solve the equation for 𝛩.
2. Evaluate the polar curve at multiples of the 𝛩 value, starting with 𝛩 = 0, and plot the points.
3. Connect the points as a smooth curve

### Circles

```
r = a // circle centered at the origin

r = c * sin𝛩
r = c * cos𝛩
```

### Roses

```
r = c * cos(n𝛩)
r = c * sin(n𝛩)
```

The "petals" extend |c| away from the origin.

The rose will have 2n petals if n is even, and n petals if n is odd.

### Cardioids

Sorta look like a heart

```
r = c + (c * cos𝛩)
r = c + (c * sin𝛩)
r = c - (c * cos𝛩)
r = c - (c * sin𝛩)

where c is a positive constant
```

The cardioid's farthest distance from the origin will always be at a distance
of 2c

### Limaçons

French for "snail". Cardioids are a type of limaçon.

```
r = a + (b * cos𝛩)
r = a + (b * sin𝛩)
r = a - (b * cos𝛩)
r = a - (b * sin𝛩)

where a and b are positive numbers and a != b
```
