# Differentiation

You can always use the [ formal or alternate definition of a derivative ](./derivatives.md) to find
a functions derivative, but some types of functions have easier methods.

### Constant

Always 0

### Linear

In a linear function `y = mx + b` the derivative will just be `m`.

### Constant multiples

```
d/dx[cf(x)] = cf'(x)
```

Find the derivative of the function and multiply by the
same constant

### Sums and differences

```
d/dx[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
d/dx[f(x) - g(x)] = f'(x) - g'(x)
```

### Power functions

```
d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
```

Keep definitions in mind for these power functions. If you have 1/2^x you can change to
2^-x. If you have sqrt(x) you actually have x^(1/2).

Also, the derivative of e^x is e^x (https://youtu.be/m2MIpDrF7Es)

### sin and cos

```
d/dx[sin(x)] = cos(x) ðŸ˜®
d/dx[cos(x)] = -(sin(x))
```

### ln(x)

```
d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x
```

### Product rule

```
d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
```

### Quotient rule

```
with f(x) = u(x) / v(x)

f'(x) = [u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)] / [(v(x))^2]
```

## The Chain Rule

You can use the chain rule to find derivatives for [compositions of functions](../algebra/combinations-of-functions.md)

```
Suppose a(x) = (fÂ°g)(x) = f(g(x)) where f and g are both differentiable
functions. then

a'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
```

Example: `(x^2 + 1)^10`

```
(x^2 + 1)^10 can be rewritten as a composite function f(g(x))

f(u) = u^10
g(x) = x^2 + 1

So therefore

f'(u) = 10u^9
g'(x) = 2x

Written in chain rule form

(10(x^2 + 1)^9) * 2x
```
