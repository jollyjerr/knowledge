# Derivatives

Derivatives are used to calculate instantaneous rate of change

A derivative is a [limit](./limits.md)

```
lim                change in distance / change in time
change time -> 0

normally written as (leibniz notation)

dy/dx

or legrange notation

f'(x1)

or newton

y'
```

dy and dx above are called "differential"s and can be reasoned about as an infinitely small change in y over
an infinitely small change in x.

Start by thinking about an average rate of change - the slope of a secant line - and then moving the points of the secant line closer and
closer together until they form a tangent line, which the slope of will tell you the instantaneous rate of change.
