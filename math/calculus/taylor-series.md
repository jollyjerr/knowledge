# Taylor Series

The Taylor series of a function f(x) is a certain [power series](./series.md) that equals f(x).

The purpose is to take a function that is not a polynomial and express it as a
series - which is like an infinite polynomial.

The degree of a Taylor polynomial is how many terms you write out starting with
index 0.

```
f(x) = sum(0, inf) f^(n)(a)/n! * (x - a)^n

where f^(n)(0) is the n-th derivative of f(x) evaluated at a

a is the expansion point
```

The 0-th derivative of f(x) is just f(x)

For the n-th derivative bit: take higher order derivatives of f(x) until you see a pattern
(normally 4?) and then evaluate all of them at a. If they all equal the same
thing then just use that, but if not you should be able to express them in terms
of x.

```
skipping some steps but this is the vibe

f(x) = 1/x

f'''(x) = (2 * 3) / (1 - x)^4

sum(0, inf) n!/n! x^n

sum(0, inf) x^n where |x| < 1
```

## Maclaurin series

A Taylor series with expansion about the point x = 0

```
f(x) = sum(0, inf) f^(n)(0)/n! * x^n
```

## Common Taylor Series

```
e^x = sum(0, inf) x^n/n! // for all x

1/(1-x) = sum(0, inf) x^n  // where |x| < 1

sin(x) = sum(0, inf) (-1)^n/(2n+1)! x^(2n+1) // for all x

cos(x) = sum(0, inf) (-1)^n/2n! x^(2n) // for all x
```

## Solving for a derivative

They give you the Taylor series for a function and ask for a specific
derivative.

```
f(x) = 3 + 5x - 8x^2 + ...

what is f''(0) ?
```

The secret is to match corresponding powers of x.

Set the general maclurian series up equal to the term of your specific series
where the powers of x match, the x's must cancel EVEN IF IT LOOKS OUT OF ORDER, then solve for the derivative.

Write out what the formula actually means:

```
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + f''(0)x^2/2!

so now you can deduce

f''(0)/2^2 x^2 = -8x^2

so using algebra to solve for f''(0)

f''(0) = -16
```

## Finding more involved Taylor series

If you have a function that looks very similar to a common taylor series you can
just like swap in the different terms but leave the result the same.

```
1/(1-x^2) = sum(0, inf) (x^2)^n

x/(1-x) x sum(0, inf) x^n
```

You can also take a derivative on both sides to get your function to look like a
common Taylor series.

You can also take a derivative and then swap in terms in a combo move.

So basically - if the question looks close to a common Taylor series you should
just write out the full common Taylor series and then use derivatives or
multiplication by x to make the common one look like the question - and then on
the right side of the equals sign you will have your answer. This is tricky and
hard to write out so def google if you cannot figure out this method when
looking back at these notes.

So in general if you know the Taylor series of a function, by default you know
the Taylor series for a bunch of functions.

## Applications of Taylor Series

Taylor series is basically pop'n the hood on a function to see really what it is
doing behind the scenes. What is cos(x) doing? How does a calculator actually
compute that function? It uses the Taylor series of that function, computes a
bunch of terms, and adds them together.

1. So Taylor's series helps us approximate functions just by finding a bunch of
   terms (not actually summing to infinity) and then summing them.

2. Taylor series is used in the proof of l'hopitals rule.

```
lim x -> 0 (1-cos(x))/x^2

1 - t series of cos / x^2

stuff cancels

1/2
```

3. Helps you solve harder integrals

```
âˆ« e^-x^2 dx

no integration techniques work

find taylor series to e^-x^2

integrate the taylor series (you can always integrate a power series)

your answer will be a power series
```
