# Polar coordinates

Rather than plotting a point using (x,y) you can plot a point with (r,𝛳)

Plotted on a graph this looks like the hypotenuse of a tringle created by (r,x,y)
with 𝛳 being the angle from the x plane to r.

```
y = r * sin(𝛳)
x = r * cos(𝛳)

             rectangular      polar
for example: (1, sqt(3)) === (2,pi/3)
```
