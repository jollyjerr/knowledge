`i = sqt(-1)` and `i^2 = -1`

remember `sqt(ab) = sqt(a) * sqt(b)`

`a + bi` is called a _complex number_

#### Rationalize complex denominators

Use the [conjugate method](./radicals.md)

```
2 + 3i / 4 - 2i

(2 + 3i)(4 + 2i)/(4 - 2i)(4 + 2i)

... // here you foil and combine like terms and simplify complex numbers as much as you can

(1 + 8i)/10
```
