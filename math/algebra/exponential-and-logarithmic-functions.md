Logarithms tell us how many times we multiply a variable by itself in order to get a different number.

`2^x = 8` is called an **exponential equation** and can be written as

`log2(8) = x` // x = 3 here

## General log rule

```
Given the exponential equation of a^x = y

the associated logarithmic equation is loga(y) = x

and vice versa
```

### Common logarithms

`log(y) = x` is a **common logarithm** and has a base of 10.

### Natural logarithms

`ln(x)` is a **natural logarithm** and has a base of `e`

`e` is Euler's number, and is equal to about 2.72

`e` is calculated as the sum of the infinite series, and arises in the study of compound interest.

```
e = 0
for (n=0; n < Inf; n++) e += 1/n!
```
