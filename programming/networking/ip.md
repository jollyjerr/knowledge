# Internet Protocol

Internet Protocol provides host to host addressing and routing. Versions 1-3
were revised. IPV4 is the one we all know and love. IPV5 was called Internet
Stream Protocol (SP) and never took off. And IPV6 is what happens when you run
out of addresses in IPV4 lol.

The specification can be found [here](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.txt).

The IP exists one level above "local networks" to pass data between local
networks (nets or gateways). There are no acknowledgments either end-to-end or hop-by-hop.
