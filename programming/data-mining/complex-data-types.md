# Complex Data Types (Advanced Data Mining Methods)

- Sequence data, time series
- Graph data, social networks
- Web data, data fusion
- Research frontiers

## Sequence Data

You have an ordered list or stream, with or without time.

EX: biological sequence, stock price, transaction history

- Sequential pattern mining (frequent sub-sequence)
- Pairwise sequence alignment (ex BLAST for biological sequences)
- Sequence modeling/prediction (ex Markov chain model)

### Time Series Data

Sequence data that changes over time.

Typically look at a combined signal of:

- T: overall trend
- C: cyclic patterns
- R: random noise
- A: anomalies

## Graph Data

`G = (V, E)` relationships between entities, very powerful abstraction.

- find frequent sub graphs
- anomaly detection
- graph modeling
- link prediction

### Online Social Network (OSN) Data

Special type of graph with users, groups, content, and interactions.

- OSN modeling and community detection
- topic modeling, sentiment analysis
- information diffusion, recommendation
- cyber-safety: malicious accounts and behaviors

### Web Data

- use all methods: text, image, audio, video, links

Build search engines, recommender systems, knowledge graphs

Relates to data fusion, where you cluster multi modal data.
