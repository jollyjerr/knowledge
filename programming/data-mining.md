# Data Mining

## Understand the data

1. Volume (how many data points)
2. Variety (what is the mixture of different data types)
3. Velocity (what changes are taking place in the data, how many copies do you
   have, is it temporal or does it show change)
4. Veracity (do you trust each data point)
5. Value (is this a useful way to spend time, is this data set worth it)

### Types of data

- Relational, transactional

Student records, bank accounts, purchases

- Sequential, temporal, streaming

Gene sequences, stock prices, sensor readings

- Spatial, spatial-temporal

Land use, bird migration, traffic condition

- Text, multimedia, web

News articles, audio/video/image, hypertext

- Graph, network data

Social network, power grid, co-authorship

### Define an Application Goal

- Market analysis, target advertisement
- Healthcare, medical research
- Science and engineering
- Security
- Government

Choose if you are trying to be descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive.

### Knowledge View

- Frequent pattern, association, correlation
- Categorization (similarity and differences between groups)
- Anomaly, outliers (fraud and extreme events)
- Changes over time

## Techniques

### Frequent pattern analysis

Identify frequent events, items, sequences, correlation, or structure.

### Classification

Build model to distinguish items into pr-defined classes. Need training data.

### Prediction

Make a numerical prediction (continuous value) like weather or stock price.

### Clustering

Work with no predefined classes, find intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster
dissimilarity.

### Anomaly Detection

Search for events differing from the norm.

### Trend and evolution analysis

Changes over time with periodical patterns.

## Pipeline

A data mining pipeline exists to take data and turn it into knowledge to be used
in an application.

1. Data understanding
2. Data preprocessing
3. Data warehousing
4. Data modeling
5. Pattern evaluation (also performance evaluation of the model)

- Diverse data = diverse knowledge
- Quality data = quality knowledge
