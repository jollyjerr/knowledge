# Data Mining

## Understand the data

1. Volume (how many data points)
2. Variety (what is the mixture of different data types)
3. Velocity (what changes are taking place in the data, how many copies do you
   have, is it temporal or does it show change)
4. Veracity (do you trust each data point)
5. Value (is this a useful way to spend time, is this data set worth it)
