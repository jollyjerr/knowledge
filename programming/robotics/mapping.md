# Mapping

Mapping is used for navigation and localization.

GPS and compass sensors make localization much easier.

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

## Grid Mapping

Constant memory requirement of world. Fill in pixels if data says that pixel is
occupied.

```
Laser data (ranges and angles)
|
Transformation Point cloud
|
Discretization
|
NxN map
```

In discretization you derive a function to map extrema/bounds of sensor data to your
grid.

Can easily transform to a `K-d Tree (Quadtree)` to lower memory requirement.
Store and read are O(1) in quadtree because the depth is a constant.

Use a topological map for navigation data.

All grids can be turned into graphs, but not all graphs have grids.

## Probabilistic Map

Each entry is the probability of a cell being occupied.

Basic approach: increment cell by 1% whenever a cell is hit

### Configuration Space

Grow all obstacles by the radius of the robot and reduce the robot to a single
point in your map.

This can be made computationally more feasible by using a blurring operation
rather than computing the exact dimensions of the obstacles.

- In 3D, the robot is a rectangle and not a disc, convolve with a rectangular
  kernel. Robot can move up and down by turning in 3D space up or down layers.

### Convolution

Takes something noisy and makes it blurry.

- 1D

```
f[x] * g[x] = sum(-inf, inf) f[i]g[x-i]
```

- 2D

Sweep Kernel over an image

```
f[x, y] * g[x, y] = sum(-inf, inf) sum(-inf, inf) f[i,j] g[x-i, y-j]
```

Edge detection kernels:

```
s_x(x,y) = [
    [-1,0,1],
    [-2,0,2],
    [-1,0,1]
]

s_y(x, y) = [
    [1,2,1],
    [0,0,0],
    [-1,-2,-1]
]
```

### Bresenham's Line Algorithm

Get full path of laser (free space), not just end point from measurement.

If a laser passes through a point, you can assume there is no object there (in
general).

- Very fast, only integer operations
- Each octant (45 degree slice) uses specific equation

```
y = ( y1 - y0 / x1 - x0 )* (x - x0) + y0
```
