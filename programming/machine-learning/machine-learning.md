# Machine Learning

A field of study in the intersection of data science and artificial
intelligence. Use statistical models and learning algorithms to train from data.

- supervised learning: train with labeled data to learn how to predict
  labels.
- unsupervised learning: train with unlabeled data to learn underlying features
  and information from the data.
- reinforcement learning: learn desired behavior from experience with reward and
  punishment.

## Tasks:

Supervised:

- Prediction
  - Classification: binary or multi-class
  - Regression: real variables

Unsupervised:

- Clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Dimensionality reduction

Other:

- Data generation
- Feature selection
