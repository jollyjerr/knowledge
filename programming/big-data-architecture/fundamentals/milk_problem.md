# The Milk Problem

Just a thought experiment for the [cap theorem](../patterns/cap.md)

If you ask a grocery store if they have milk, would you rather wait for a
response or get an immediate response that might be incorrect?

What you really want is a compromise. You want exact counts but want to wait a
short amount of time.
