# Fast fourier transforms

Signals: values over time (EX: stock price)
Discrete signals: value over time measured at a specific interval
Periodic signal: pattern repeats over time

A Fourier transform breaks a signal into the frequency components that make it
up. It's used in all time series data, image data, audio data, etc. It allows
you to smooth/denoise signals and inspect data.
