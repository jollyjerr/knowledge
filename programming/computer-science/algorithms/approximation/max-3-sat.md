# Maximum Satisfiability Problem

Max 3 SAT:

Variant of boolean SAT. N boolean vars and m clauses like (x or y or z) and you choose truth
assignments that maximizes the number of clauses you satisfy.

## Approximation Algorithm

No worst than 7/8th of the optimum count.

This algorithm hinges on probability and the description is pretty long.
Basically for every n variable you pretend it is true and calculate the average
number of true clauses and then pretend it is false and calculate the average
number of true clauses. Pick the one with the higher average - so it's a greedy
algo.

```python
# We will represent clause as a list of literals,
# A -ve sign in front of the literal means that the
# corresponding variable is negated.
# Eg., (x2 or not x4 or x5) --> [2, -4, 5]
# IMPORTANT: we assume clauses are not empty and a variable cannot appear twice in the same clause.

# given a list of clauses and a truth assignment as a list of true/false, return number of clauses satisfied
def num_clauses_satisfied(lst_of_clauses, truth_assign):
    # truth_assign is simply a list of booleans.
    # The truth assignment for variable # i is given by truth_assign[i-1]
    n = len(truth_assign)
    m = len(lst_of_clauses)
    num_satisfied = 0
    for clause in lst_of_clauses:
        is_clause_satisfied = any([truth_assign[j-1] if j > 0 else not truth_assign[-j-1] for j in clause])
        num_satisfied += 1 if is_clause_satisfied else 0
    return num_satisfied

# Given a list of clauses, calculate the expectation
# Assume that the same variable does not repeat in a given clause.
# This calculation will be incorrect if this assumption does not hold
def expectation(lst_of_clauses):
    expect = 0
    for clause in lst_of_clauses: # go through the clauses
        expect += 1.0 - 1.0/(2.0**len(clause)) # add to the expectation based on the probability clause is true.
    return expect
