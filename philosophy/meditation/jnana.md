## Techniques

### Who am I?

Ask yourself who you are. When your mind gives you an answer (like "I am a
doctor") try to find where that answer comes from. Where is it located? What is
the nature of the identity? They may be hard or impossible to find.

These attributes should become less important to you as you look for them.
