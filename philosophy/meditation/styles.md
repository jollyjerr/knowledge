# Meditative Styles

Successful meditation is about picking the right type of practice for you.

Meditation practices can be placed on two axis and they placement on these axis
can actually be seen in brain scans.

```
           inquisitive
                     |
open awareness <-------------> focus
                     |
             grounding
```

For example, Zen zazzen is an inquisitive and open practice. Trataka is a focus practice. Ice diving is grounding.
