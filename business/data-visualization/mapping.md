# Mapping

Mapping is a function to take data space to a visual space.

## Data space

Datasets are formed of dimensions, and each dimension has a type.

The type informs effective mapping choices.

- Categorical: cats, dogs, birds
- Ordinal: small, medium, large
- Continuous: 1, 2, 3

## Visual space

AKA "Marks"

There are many:

- position
- color
- shape
- orientation
- size
- value/lightness
- motion
- texture

## Mapping strategy

- What visual encoding do we use?

- How do we compute the visual representation from the data value?

Expressiveness: Express all the data, but nothing else

Effectiveness: The importance of the attribute should match the salience of the
channel
