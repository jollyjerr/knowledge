# Visualization Tasks

https://tildeweb.au.dk/au597509/pdfs/taskds.pdf

When people explore data the learn new things and get motivated to explore in
different ways. It's important to predict these different visualization tasks.

Tasks: the reason why the vis tool is being used

Tasks let us separate what we want to do with data from its domain

Key questions when forming tasks:

- why is a task pursued (explore, confirm, present, enjoy)
- how is a task conducted (navigation, organizing, relation)
- what does a task seek to learn
- where does the task operate
- when is the task performed
- who is executing the task

## Design study methodology

Brainstorm -> Iterate x3 -> high fidelity mockup

Learn (explore literature)
Winnow (find strong collaborators)
Cast (identify collaborator roles)
Discover (identify tasks)
Design (mock up)
Implement (high fidelity mockup)
Deploy (iterate)
